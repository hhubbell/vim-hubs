# Hubs
### A simple dark colorscheme with the right amount of contrast

Hubs is a basic color scheme adhering to the following principles:
* The background should be dark, with a bright foreground
* Numbers should be blue
* Built-in functions and definitions should be yellow
* Strings should be red
* Comments should be green
* Loops should be orange
* Imports and PreProcs should be purple
* Structs and Types should be teal
* The colorscheme should render nearly the same in the terminal and gui window
