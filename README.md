# Hubs
### A simple dark colorscheme with the right amount of contrast

Hubs is a basic color scheme adhering to the following principles:
* The background should be an even black, with a white foreground
* Numbers should be blue
* Built-in functions and definitions should be yellow
* Strings should be red
* Comments should be green
* Loops should be orange
* Imports and PreProcs should be purple
* Structs and Types should be teal

In addition:
* Bold should be used to add emphasis; should a small font fail to properly do so, bold should be removed without detriment
* The colorscheme should render the same in the terminal and gui window
