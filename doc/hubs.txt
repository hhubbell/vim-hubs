g:hubs_NoBold:
    DEPRECATED:
    This option was removed due to low utilization.

    ABOUT:
    An option that can be implemented if the selected font is too small or
    does not render bold fonts well.  The following fonts are normally bold:

          Cursor              Character           Constant
          Conditional         Repeat              Exception

          Macro               Type                TypeDef
          StorageClass        Structure           MatchParen
          SpecialChar         SpecialComment      SpellCap
          Title

    Refer to VIM DOCS to see what these syntax groups highlight

    TO USE:
    Add the following line to your .vimrc file, before your colorcheme
    declaration.  This is important! The option will not work if it is set
    after.

          let g:hubs_NoBold=1


g:hubs_HighContrast:
    DEPRECATED:
    By default, the template script generates a high-contrast colorscheme.
    To change this, set BACKGROUND = DARK_GRAY for the low-contrast bg.

    ABOUT:
    An option that can be implemented if the user prefers a darker
    background.  This is a user preference - for instance, on some
      displays the darker background can seem too dark, while on others
      the extra contrast looks much better; this is mainly due to monitor
      brand and color settings.

    TO USE:
    Add the following line to your .vimrc file.

          let g:hubs_HighContrast=1


g:hubs_MatchTrailingWhitespace:
    DEPRECATED:
    This behavior can be handled by a .vimrc rule. To accomplish this
    highlight class, add the following. This will color trailing
    whitespace the same as Errors, for example. Any existing highlight
    class can be used.

        hi link TrailingWhitespace Error
        match TrailingWhitespace /\s\+$/

    ABOUT:
    An option that can be implemented if the user wishes to see any
    trailing whitespace on lines.

    TO USE:
    Add the following line to your .vimrc file.

          let g:hubs_MatchTrailingWhitespace=1
